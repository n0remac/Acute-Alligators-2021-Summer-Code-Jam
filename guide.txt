Welcome to Venturing Virus!
-------------------------
A virus has made its way into your directory (disclaimer that the virus is nonexistent and fictional)!
You are trying to dig down in the directory all the way to the bottom, where it is said that the virus has installed itself.
As you make your way through the directory, dangers will arise such as the enemies roaming your directory, where each enemy comes from a corrupted file.
However, the further down you go, the closer you are to finding the roots of the virus, and saving your directory.

Press w, a, s, and d to move forward, left, backward, and right respectively.
The green '#' symbol you see are the doors, which lead down to the children directories, and the further down you venture through these doors,
the closer you are to the root of the virus.
The '@' symbol is a color changer, which will allow you to change colors and fight the enemies, as each enemy is vulnerable to a certain color.

Good luck!
